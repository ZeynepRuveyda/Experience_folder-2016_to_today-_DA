# ðŸš€ Automi AI - Power BI Quick Start (15 Minutes)

## âš¡ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### 1. Open Power BI Desktop NOW
- Download from Microsoft Store if needed
- Launch Power BI Desktop

### 2. Import Data (5 minutes)
```
Get Data â†’ Text/CSV â†’ Browse to:
- daily_defect_rate.csv
- defects_by_cause.csv  
- defects_by_station_team.csv
- throughput_by_station.csv
```

### 3. Quick Data Model (5 minutes)
```
New Table â†’ Date = CALENDAR(DATE(2022,1,1), DATE(2022,12,31))
Mark as Date Table
Create relationships to all tables on 'date' column
```

### 4. Essential Measures (3 minutes)
```dax
Total Defects = SUM('defects_by_station_team'[defects])
Total Items = SUM('defects_by_station_team'[items])
Defect Rate = DIVIDE([Total Defects], [Total Items])
```

### 5. First Visual (2 minutes)
- **Line Chart**: Date vs Defect Rate
- **Card**: Overall Defect Rate
- **Bar Chart**: Top 5 Defect Causes

## ðŸŽ¯ INTERVIEW READY IN 15 MINUTES

### What You'll Have:
âœ… Real Power BI dashboard (.pbix file)
âœ… Professional data model
âœ… Working DAX measures
âœ… Interactive visuals
âœ… Interview-ready presentation

### Key Talking Points:
- "I built this dashboard in Power BI Desktop using real production data"
- "Implemented star schema with proper relationships"
- "Created DAX measures for time intelligence and Pareto analysis"
- "Used conditional formatting for quality indicators"
- "Dashboard shows daily defect trends and root cause analysis"

## ðŸ“Š ESSENTIAL VISUALS TO BUILD FIRST

1. **Daily Defect Rate Trend** (Line Chart)
2. **Top Defect Causes** (Horizontal Bar)
3. **Station Performance Matrix** (Matrix Visual)
4. **Quality KPI Cards** (Card Visuals)

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS TO MENTION

- **Data Source**: Production logs from manufacturing system
- **ETL Process**: PySpark aggregation, MongoDB ingestion
- **Data Model**: Star schema with Date dimension
- **Measures**: DAX with time intelligence and Pareto analysis
- **Performance**: Optimized with aggregations and relationships
